## üìÇ Test Data Description

The **60-channel unipolar EEG data** were recorded using a **Vectorview system** (MEGIN Oy, Espoo, Finland). These data were originally acquired alongside **306-channel MEG recordings**; however, **MEG channels have been removed** for this EEG-focused workshop.

The dataset is a subset of the official **MNE-Python tutorial datasets**.

üëâ For the hands-on session, a **EEG-only version** is available **until July 27, 2025** at:  
**[Download hands-on data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VsYW37wIM7R8xNUFmQY9K_h37B-Q_w5F?usp=sharing)**

After that, please refer to the original dataset via the official **MNE-Python** website.

## üß∞ MATLAB and FieldTrip Installation Instructions

You will participate in hands-on sessions involving EEG recording and analysis.  
To ensure a smooth experience, please **pre-install** the following:

### üîß MATLAB Installation

- If your institute provides MATLAB access, use that to install.
- Otherwise, you can purchase MATLAB from the [official site](https://in.mathworks.com/).
- Or get a **30-day trial license**:  
  [https://in.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html?prodcode=ML&s_iid=isrch_trial_ZZ_bb](https://in.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html?prodcode=ML&s_iid=isrch_trial_ZZ_bb)

üìå Installation guide for different operating systems:

### üß† FieldTrip Toolbox

We will use the **FieldTrip toolbox** in MATLAB for EEG analysis. Download it here:  
[https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download.php](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download.php)

üìå Installation:
Download, extract (unzip) and add path to your MATLAB:  
addpath(‚Äòfieldtrip directory on your drive‚Äô)  
ft_defaults
